      <h3>A time when you overcame a challenge together</h3>
      <p>I don't know if this moment comes in "challenge" category but when we were 2months and 25 days in, in dating eachother i was really jealous of her friend 'rat' i trusted her but my mind kept making bad scenarios which gave off the wrong impression and she thought i didn't trust her enough we almost came to the point of breaking up but we fixed it, we fixed it together i was really happy after that. And I us want to keep fixing these kinds of misunderstandings and problems we might have in the future.</p>
